## Introduction

The Screenshot Annotation Tool is a Python-based application designed to streamline the process of categorizing screenshots. Whether you're working on computer vision projects, game development, or any other field requiring image classification, this tool provides a user-friendly interface to annotate images efficiently.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: The tool offers an intuitive interface that makes annotating images a breeze, even for users with minimal technical expertise.

- **Directory Selection**: Easily select directories for storing screenshots and annotated images within the tool, simplifying the organization of your image data.

- **Annotation with Ease**: With just a simple button click, users can annotate each screenshot as either "enemy present" or "no enemy present," allowing for quick and accurate classification.

- **Visual Image Display**: Visualize images directly within the tool interface, facilitating easy annotation and ensuring accurate classification.

- **Explanation Guide**: For users unfamiliar with the tool, a built-in explanation guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to use the tool effectively.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using Git.

2. **Python Installation**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system, preferably version 3.6 or higher.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Use pip to install the required dependencies. This tool relies on the Pillow library for image processing:

4. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file to launch the tool and begin annotating your screenshots.

## Usage

1. **Select Directories**: Upon launching the tool, choose directories for your screenshots, images with enemies, and images without enemies. This step ensures proper organization of your annotated images.

2. **Annotate Images**: Follow the on-screen instructions to annotate each screenshot. Click either "Enemy Present" or "No Enemy Present" based on the content of the image.

3. **Completion Message**: Once all images are annotated, the tool will display a completion message, indicating that the annotation process is finished.

## Compiling into an Executable

You can compile the Python script into an executable file for easier distribution. One popular tool for this purpose is `pyinstaller`. Install it via pip:

   ```
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

Then, navigate to the project directory in the terminal and run: pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole main.py

   ```
   pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole main.py
   ```

This command will create a standalone executable file in the `dist` directory.
